        <h3>The ADD Command</h3>
        The <code>git</code> <b>add</b> command adds a 
        change in the working directory to the staging area. 
        It tells Git that you want to include updates to a 
        particular file in the next commit. However, 
        git add doesn't really affect the repository 
        in any significant way—changes are not 
        actually recorded until you run git commit .

        <h3>The COMMIT Command</h3>
        The <code>git</code> <b>commit</b> command captures a snapshot of the 
        project's currently staged changes. 
        Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” 
        versions of a project—Git will never change them 
        unless you explicitly ask it to. ... 
        These two commands git commit and git add are two of 
        the most frequently used.

        <h3>The STATUS Command</h3>
        The <code>git</code> <b>status</b> command displays the 
        state of the working directory and the staging area. 
        It lets you see which changes have been staged, which 
        haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 
        Status output does not show you any information regarding 
        the committed project history.

        <h3>The PUSH Command</h3>
        The <code>git</code> <b>push</b> command is used to upload 
        local repository content to a remote repository. 
        Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository 
        to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , 
        but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, 
        pushing exports commits to remote branches.
        
        <h3>The PULL Command</h3>
        The <code>git</code> <b>pull</b> command is used to fetch and 
        download content from a remote repository and immediately update 
        the local repository to match that content. Merging remote 
        upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in 
        Git-based collaboration work flows.
